# Tutorial
In the following you will learn about the basics of navigating and editing the canvas!

## Panning-and-Zooming
There are a total of 3 different ways to pan the camera across the canvas:

* Dragging the canvas
* Clicking on a tile to center it
* Using the Keyboard movement keys (Default: `wasd` or arrow-keys)

The first two methods are also available for mobile users!

You may zoom the camera in and out by using the mousewheel (on desktop) or pinching the screen (on mobile).

## Placing-Tiles
Place tiles by dragging tiles from the color menu (located at the bottom-center of the screen) onto the canvas. 
You can also use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl` and `shift` to cycle through tiles. Pressing `e` toggles holding a tile.
